# Next task — Phase 137 retained-history quality audit

Phase 136 is complete. Audit the newly expanded read-only Printing-history surface against the
retained Phase 135 boundary, with special attention to explicit unknown paper/promotional values,
set-name presentation, and bounded-coverage wording. Do not reacquire provider data, alter the 534
Printing promotion, create demand/value claims, or change Architecture v12. Any subsequent expansion
requires separately retained and reviewed evidence.

# Phase 136 — verified pilot Printings promoted

Phase 136 consumed only merged retained run `mtgjson-pilot-30786023976-1`. Its exact regular-file
inventory is `acquisition-report.json`, `manifest.json`, and `source-pilot-printings.json`; the
normalized projection is 371,126 bytes with SHA-256
`493df83312c8d9271e84a143ed288767d7fbf53d7b4a23bfc2f72af514bc67e6`, and records source
SHA-256 `2a10a52e9d82c3140c0be67f77a2ab0f5c2c491e53f06dccb4a9b224a96f53ae` over 177,237,377
source bytes. The evidence directory remains unchanged.

All 534 retained supported non-MB2 rows became deterministic Printing candidates and were reviewed:
534 accepted; zero existing-canonical duplicates, retained duplicates, ambiguous, conflicting,
incomplete, unsupported, or rejected. The ten existing Cards and the existing `foil` and `nonfoil`
finishes were reused; no supporting entity was promoted. Exactly 534 provider-UUID-keyed Printings
were promoted, taking the canonical repository from 379 to 913 Printings. The canonical digest moved
from `793a364794e12002dd561a47a42333332ae7dd64a958fc18903b0cc2381de27f` to
`881c4ddf1dd5f3dc8004aef001277407e359b165cba6d9f5e8d442e9eef48077`.

Immutable audit and promotion identity is `phase-136-mtgjson-pilot-30786023976-1` (audit digest
`94284fef8024bb3abc2c785d82fc6f79e7adcc8303e69f06c8152959193e1e5b`); rollback identity is
`phase-136-mtgjson-pilot-30786023976-1-rollback`. Byte-identical replay is idempotent, conflicts and
canonical drift fail closed, and rollback removes only the audited 534 Printings and verifies the
pre-state digest.

Printing totals (including the existing MB2 Printing) are: Brainstorm 48, Command Tower 111,
Counterspell 84, Goblin Charbelcher 9, Goblin King 27, Sol Ring 136, Swords to Plowshares 97,
Treasure Cruise 15, Walking Ballista 11, and Wishclaw Talisman 6. Exactly ten append-only Phase 136
`printing.reprint_history` facts supersede their Phase 133 facts. Active queries return Phase 136;
historical queries return Phase 132, Phase 133, then Phase 136 in recording order. Coverage remains
explicitly incomplete: this is the retained ten-card projection, not proof of global history, and
Printing counts are not supply. All 90 Phase 132 facts, all ten Phase 133 fact files, and all 478
market observations remain byte-identical. No provider contact, reacquisition, market write,
demand/value inference, or Architecture v12 change occurred.

The deterministic census, per-card Printing IDs, dates, set coverage, fact IDs, supersession IDs,
and limitations are recorded in `data/reviews/phase-136/pilot-review.json`.
